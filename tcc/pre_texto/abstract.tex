Metaheuristics are stochastic algorithms, therefore, randomization is one of its fundamental principles. Randomization allows the algorithm not only to be able to escape from local minimums or maximums, performing a global search, but also helps in local searches in the neighborhood of the current best solution. Taking this into account, we have available several randomization methods that can be used in these algorithms, such as the Uniform, Gaussian, and Cauchy distributions, as well as chaotic maps, such as Logistic and Kent. However, most studies do not analyze the best distribution that can be used. Therefore, this paper focuses on the analysis of the impact that different probability distributions have on some metaheuristics.
